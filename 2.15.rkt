Eva is right.
In algebraically equivalent expressions such as:

A + A vs. 2A
A - A vs. 0
A / A vs. 1

evaluating the left expressions with Alyssa's system produces a compounding of the uncertainty expressed by the interval A.
The right expressions correctly indicate that there is only one source of uncertainty, or that the source (A) cancels itself out.
